Box2Dhx
=======
Haxe Port of Erin Catto's Box2D physics engine. 
I updated it's code from **[code.google.com/p/box2dhx](https://code.google.com/p/box2dhx/)**
in order to be compatible with **[Haxe 3.0](http://haxe.org/)**

You are already able to install Box2D 2.1a with the following cmd **"haxelib install box2d"** 
but if you use the old version of box2d this might be the repository you are looking for.

###Install
Just enter the following: ```haxelib git box2dhx https://github.com/jujulian1987/box2dhx.git```
and add ```<haxelib name="box2dhx" />``` to your ".nmml" file and you are ready to go.
